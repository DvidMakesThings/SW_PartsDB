High Value:
LCSC API Integration - Auto-fetch part specs, pricing, and stock from LCSC using the LCSC Part field
BOM Export - Generate KiCad-compatible BOM from selected parts
Stock/Inventory Tracking - Quantity on hand, location, low-stock alerts
Parametric Search - Filter by value ranges (e.g., 1K-10K resistors, >16V caps)

Organization:
Part Lifecycle Status - Active / Obsolete / NRND badges
Alternates/Equivalents - Link compatible substitute parts
Project Tags - Associate parts with specific projects

Automation:
KiCad Project Scanner - Parse .kicad_sch files, identify missing parts, bulk-add to DB
Bulk LCSC Import - Paste list of LCSC part numbers, auto-populate everything

Nice to Have:
Datasheet Upload/Viewer - Store PDFs, quick preview
Dark Mode - UI polish
3D Models Subfolder Support - Recursive scanning of 3dmodels/ for organization (e.g., MCU/, Connectors/)
