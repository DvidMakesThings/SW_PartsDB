Notes: 
  5. Device mounted on FR-4 PC board, with minimum recommended pad layout, single sided. 
  6. Device mounted on FR-4 substrate PC board, 2oz copper, with thermal bias to bottom layer 1-inch square copper plate. 
  7. Thermal resistance from junction to soldering point (on the exposed drain pad). 
  8. IAS and EAS ratings are based on low frequency and duty cycles to keep TJ = +25°C. 
  9. Short duration pulse test used to minimize self-heating effect. 
10. Guaranteed by design. Not subject to product testing.
