BSS138LT1/D
MOSFET – Power, 
N-Channel, SOT-23
200 mA, 50 V
BSS138L, BVSS138L
Typical applications are DC−DC converters, power management in
portable and battery−powered products such as computers, printers,
PCMCIA cards, cellular and cordless telephones.
Features
• Low Threshold Voltage (VGS(th): 0.85 V−1.5 V) Makes it Ideal for
Low Voltage Applications
• Miniature SOT−23 Surface Mount Package Saves Board Space
• HBM Class 0A, MM Class M1A, CDM Class IV (Note 3)
• BVSS Prefix for Automotive and Other Applications Requiring
Unique Site and Control Change Requirements; AEC−Q101
Qualified and PPAP Capable
• These Devices are Pb−Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free and are RoHS
Compliant
