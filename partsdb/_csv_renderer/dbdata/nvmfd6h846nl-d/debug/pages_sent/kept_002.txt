Product parametric performance is indicated in the Electrical Characteristics for the listed test conditions, unless otherwise noted. Product
performance may not be indicated by the Electrical Characteristics if operated under different conditions.
4. Pulse Test: pulse width  300 s, duty cycle  2%.
5. Switching characteristics are independent of operating junction temperatures.
