1. The entire application environment impacts the thermal resistance values shown,
they are not constants and are only valid for the particular conditions noted.
2. Surface−mounted on FR4 board using a 650 mm2, 2 oz. Cu pad.
3. Maximum current for pulses as long as 1 second is higher but is dependent
on pulse duration and duty cycle.
