N-Channel 40 V (D-S) MOSFET
FEATURES
• TrenchFET® power MOSFET
• 100 % Rg and UIS tested
• Material categorization:
for definitions of compliance please see 
www.vishay.com/doc?99912
APPLICATIONS
• Synchronous rectification
• Secondary side DC/DC
Notes
a. Package limited
b. Surface mounted on 1" x 1" FR4 board
c. t = 10 s
d. See solder profile (www.vishay.com/doc?73257). The PowerPAK SO-8 is a leadless package. The end of the lead terminal is exposed copper 
(not plated) as a result of the singulation process in manufacturing. A solder fillet at the exposed copper tip cannot be guaranteed and is not 
required to ensure adequate bottom side solder interconnection
e. Rework conditions: manual soldering with a soldering iron is not recommended for leadless components
f.
Maximum under steady state conditions is 65 °C/W
