a. Pulse test; pulse width  300 μs, duty cycle  2 %
b. Guaranteed by design, not subject to production testing

Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation 
of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum
 
rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
