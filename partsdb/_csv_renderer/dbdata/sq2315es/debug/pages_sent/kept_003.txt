THERMAL RATINGS (TA = 25 °C, unless otherwise noted)
Normalized Thermal Transient Impedance, Junction-to-Foot
Normalized Thermal Transient Impedance, Junction-to-Ambient
Note
•
The characteristics shown in the two graphs 
- Normalized Transient Thermal Impedance Junction-to-Ambient (25 °C) 
- Normalized Transient Thermal Impedance Junction-to-Foot (25 °C) 
are given for general guidelines only to enable the user to get a “ball park” indication of part capabilities. The data are extracted from single 
pulse transient thermal impedance characteristics which are developed from empirical measurements. The latter is valid for the part 
mounted on printed circuit board - FR4, size 1" x 1" x 0.062", double sided with 2 oz. copper, 100 % on both sides. The part capabilities 
can widely vary depending on actual application parameters and operating conditions.
Vishay Siliconix maintains worldwide manufacturing capability. Products may be manufactured at one of several qualified locations. Reliability data for Silicon 
Technology and Package Reliability represent a composite of all qualified locations. For related documents such as package/tape drawings, part marking, and 
reliability data, see www.vishay.com/ppg?71507.
